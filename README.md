# Kagi Small Web

Kagi Small Web is an initiative by [Kagi](https://kagi.com).

Kagi's mission is to humanize the web and this project is built to help surface recent results from the small web - people and stories that typically zip by in legacy search engines. Read more about it in the announcement [blog post](https://blog.kagi.com/small-web).

Few things to note:

- [Kagi search engine](https://kagi.com) surfaces posts from the small web for relevant queries in its search results. 

- Try the [Kagi Small Web](https://kagi.com/smallweb) website.

- You can also use the [RSS feed](https://kagi.com/api/v1/smallweb/feed) or access these results as a part of a broader [Kagi News Enrichment API](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/api/enrich.html). 

- There is an [OPML file](https://kagi.com/smallweb/opml) of the sites which make up the above RSS feed

## Criteria for posts to show on the website

If the blog is included in small web feed list (which means it has content in English, it is informational/educational by nature and it is not trying to sell anything) we check for these two things to show it on the site:

- Blog has recent posts (<7 days old)
- The website can appear in an iframe
  
## Guidelines for adding a site or channel to the list

Add a new personal blog RSS feed to the list. Rules:

- **Do not submit your own website unless you submit 2 other sites that are not yours (and are not in list).**
- Locate and submit the RSS feed of the website. Place in the file so that it remains sorted.
- Content must be in English (currently, other languages are not accepted).
- No illegal or NSFW content.
- No auto generated, LLM generated or spam content.
- Only personal blogs may be submitted. 
- The blog must have a recent post, no older than 12 months, to meet the recency criteria for inclusion.
- The site must not contain any forms of advertisements or undisclosed affiliate links
- Site should not have newsletter signup popups (substack sites are not accepted too)
- A YT channel must not post more than twice a week.
- A YT channel must have fewer than 400,000 subscribers.

For comics:
- Must be independently created art (no AI generated content)
- RSS feed must show the full comic in the feed
- No commercial syndicated comics
